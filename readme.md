## TVA Inspired website concept 

Note: This doesn't work on mobile as its not mobile responsive and my head hurts to make it responsive so i wont. 

This is just a fun project and it makes sense that it should open on big screens "only" because TVA
has all the tools and machines with bigger screens so yeah!

> Go watch LOKI season 1 and 2 now! ðŸ”¥
